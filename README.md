# Lotto
A java program that calculates lottery numbers

This is a program made for a school assignment as a learning exercise. It asks the user for 9 lottery numbers between 1 and 80 and randomly generates winning lottery numbers until they match. One iteration is considered one week. If the lottery hasn't been won in a lifetime (120 years), the program tries again.

The user can also give their desired lottery numbers straight through the parameters. They can see all lottery numbers, when more numbers match, if they wish.
